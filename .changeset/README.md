# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Project-Specific Configuration

### Publishable Packages

Only packages without `"private": true` in their `package.json` are managed by changesets.
Currently publishable:

- `@zookanalytics/agent-env` — CLI for creating isolated, AI-ready development environments
- `@zookanalytics/bmad-orchestrator` — Unified command center for multi-DevPod development

**Warning:** `bmm-retrospective-module` lacks `"private": true` and is visible to changesets as publishable, but has no build script or publish config. Add `"private": true` to its `package.json` or add it to the `ignore` array before Epic 3 automated publishing.

### Private Package Exclusion

The `@zookanalytics/shared` package and the monorepo root are marked `"private": true` in
their respective `package.json` files. Changesets natively respects this flag and excludes
private packages from version bumps and publishing. No explicit `ignore` array entry is
needed in `config.json`.

### Config Rationale

Since JSON does not support comments, configuration rationale is documented here:

- **changelog**: Uses `@changesets/changelog-github` to generate PR-linked changelog entries
- **commit**: `false` — the changesets/action GitHub Action handles commits in CI
- **access**: `"public"` — packages are published to the public npm registry under `@zookanalytics`
- **baseBranch**: `"main"` — version comparison and "Version Packages" PRs target main
- **updateInternalDependencies**: `"patch"` — ensures `workspace:*` references are rewritten to real version numbers during publication
- **ignore**: `[]` — empty because `"private": true` handles exclusion (see above)

### Creating a Changeset

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Use the interactive CLI to select affected packages and bump type (patch/minor/major).
Write a user-facing summary as the changeset description — it becomes a changelog entry.
