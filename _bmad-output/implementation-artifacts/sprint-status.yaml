# CLI for creating isolated, AI-ready development environments

# Status: PLANNING PHASE - requires PRD, Architecture, Epics before implementation

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# CROSS-COMPONENT DEPENDENCIES
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Format: blocker → blocked (blocker must complete before blocked can start)
#
# These dependencies track where work in one component enables work in another.
# Update as dependencies are discovered or resolved.

cross_dependencies:
  # agent-env MVP enables orchestrator integration
  - blocker: env-mvp-complete        # agent-env list --json working
    blocked: orch-epic-2             # State parsing needs real instances to test
    note: "Orchestrator can mock agent-env for early development, but integration testing requires env MVP"

  - blocker: env-mvp-complete
    blocked: orch-epic-3             # Dashboard needs live data
    note: "Dashboard development can proceed with mocks, real integration at epic end"

  # Orchestrator Epic 1 is independent (uses DevPod, not agent-env)
  # This allows parallel development of both components

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# NOTES
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# - Orchestrator Epic 1 (done) used DevPod as discovery target
# - agent-env will eventually replace/supplement DevPod as primary target
# - Both components can be developed in parallel with mocking at boundaries
# - Update cross_dependencies as new blockers are discovered
