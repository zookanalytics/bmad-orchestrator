# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog -> in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress -> done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# CROSS-COMPONENT DEPENDENCIES
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Format: blocker -> blocked (blocker must complete before blocked can start)
#
# These dependencies track where work in one component enables work in another.
# Update as dependencies are discovered or resolved.

cross_dependencies:
  # agent-env Epic 1 restructures the monorepo - orchestrator continues working
  - blocker: env-epic-1
    blocked: null
    note: "Monorepo restructure maintains orchestrator functionality throughout"

  # agent-env MVP enables orchestrator integration
  - blocker: env-epic-3               # agent-env list --json working
    blocked: orch-epic-2              # State parsing needs real instances to test
    note: "Orchestrator can mock agent-env for early development, but integration testing requires env list"

  - blocker: env-epic-3
    blocked: orch-epic-3              # Dashboard needs live data
    note: "Dashboard development can proceed with mocks, real integration at epic end"

  # Orchestrator Epic 1 is independent (uses DevPod, not agent-env)
  # This allows parallel development of both components

  # Release infrastructure uses agent-env as pilot package
  - blocker: env-epic-1
    blocked: rel-epic-1
    note: "Release Epic 1 configures agent-env for npm publish - requires monorepo structure from env-epic-1 (done)"

  - blocker: rel-epic-1
    blocked: rel-epic-3
    note: "Automated publish requires verified artifact pipeline and package configuration"

  - blocker: rel-epic-2
    blocked: rel-epic-3
    note: "Automated publish requires changesets versioning to be configured"

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# NOTES
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# - Orchestrator Epic 1 (done) used DevPod as discovery target
# - agent-env will eventually replace/supplement DevPod as primary target
# - Both components can be developed in parallel with mocking at boundaries
# - env-epic-1 restructures repo into monorepo without breaking orchestrator
# - Release infrastructure is independent of orchestrator/agent-env feature work
# - rel-epic-1 and rel-epic-2 can be worked in parallel
# - rel-epic-3 depends on both rel-epic-1 and rel-epic-2
# - rel-epic-4 can start after rel-epic-3 (needs publish workflow to exist)
# - Update cross_dependencies as new blockers are discovered

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# FUTURE WORK / BACKLOG IDEAS
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Items discovered during implementation that don't fit current epics.
# Evaluate during sprint planning or when creating new epics.
#
# [env] Generic devcontainer.json customization system
#   Context: env-epic-2 added patchContainerName() as a targeted read-modify-write
#   to inject runArgs --name into devcontainer.json per instance. As more per-instance
#   customizations arise (mounts, env vars, labels, features), a structured patching
#   or templating system would replace ad-hoc JSON manipulation. Could be a story in
#   a future epic or folded into env-epic-2 retro follow-up.
#   Scope: story or small epic depending on how many customizations emerge.
