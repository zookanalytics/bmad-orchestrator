      Add Ink interactive pattern cross-references to the orchestrator package
      to ensure UI consistency across the monorepo. After Story env-4.3
      (interactive menu) is completed, two touchpoints must be added:
      (1) A dev note in the orchestrator epics file
      (_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/orchestrator/epics.md) under Epic 3
      Story 3.2 (DevPodPane component) referencing the Ink patterns established
      in agent-env's interactive menu for consistency.
      (2) A cross-dependency note in sprint-status.yaml under the
      cross_dependencies section noting that orch-epic-3 should align with
      agent-env interactive patterns from env-4.3.
      Owner: SM (Bob). Deadline: After Story env-4.3 merges.
      Success criteria: Both touchpoints added — epics file dev note and
      cross-dependency note in sprint-status.yaml.

    summary: |
      Document the recurring false completion claims pattern as a known issue
      for potential future improvement. Across epics env-2 and env-3, the dev
      agent has consistently reported inflated test counts or pre-populated
      review notes in 2-3 out of 4-5 stories per epic. Code review catches
      100% of these issues, so it is not blocking, but would benefit from
      improvement if BMAD tooling evolves to support better dev agent
      self-verification. This is an opportunistic item — no deadline, no
      concrete deliverable. Node (Project Lead) owns the decision on if/when
      to invest in addressing this pattern.
