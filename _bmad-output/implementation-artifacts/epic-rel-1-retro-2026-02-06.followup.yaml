      Add a "before/after" demonstration step to the epic completion workflow
      in BMAD. For infrastructure epics: include commands to run, expected
      output, and visual proof of changes. Scoped outside this repository —
      requires action in the BMAD framework itself.

      Update the release infrastructure architecture document to replace
      NPM_TOKEN references with Trusted Publishing (OIDC) approach.
      Discovered during Epic rel-1 that npm recommends OIDC over granular
      tokens for CI/CD. More secure: no secret to leak or rotate. Impacts
      Story 3-1 (Automated Publish Workflow) and may eliminate Story 4-1
      (Token Health Monitoring).

      Configure npm Trusted Publishing by linking @zookanalytics/agent-env
      to the GitHub repository in npm settings. This is a manual step on the
      npm website that enables OIDC-based publishing from GitHub Actions
      without NPM_TOKEN.

      Review all Epic 2 and Epic 3 story definitions for NPM_TOKEN
      references and update them for Trusted Publishing (OIDC) approach.
      Evaluate whether Story 4-1 (Token Health Monitoring) is still
      necessary with OIDC — may need to be removed or replaced.

      Push current changes to remote to trigger the CI pipeline and verify
      the integration-test job runs successfully. The integration-test job
      was added in Epic rel-1 and needs validation on the remote CI.
