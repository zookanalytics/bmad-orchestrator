      Continue code review as the primary safety net for story verification.
      Every story must receive at least one code review before merge. This is
      a standing team agreement carried forward from env-1 and env-2 epics,
      where code review caught 100% of HIGH-severity issues including false
      completion claims (3/5 stories in env-2). No separate verification
      tooling — review is the right-sized mechanism for this project's scale.

    summary: |
      Embed the "reliability over completeness" principle in Epic env-3
      Story 3.1 (git state detection) dev notes. This principle states that
      every implemented safety check must reliably catch its target state —
      missing a check is acceptable, but a broken or silent-failure check is
      not. This was a key insight from env-2 where over-engineering caused
      test failures (e.g., 45-line name verification block in Story 2.3).
      Owner: SM (Bob). Success criteria: principle explicitly stated in
      Story 3.1 dev notes section.
