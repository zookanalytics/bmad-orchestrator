# Publish workflow for @zookanalytics packages
# Requirements (FRxx/NFRxx) defined in: _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/release-infrastructure/
#
# Trigger: push to main (after PR merge)
# Pattern: "Version Packages" PR via changesets/action
#
# FLOW:
# 1. Developer merges feature PR to main (with changeset file included)
# 2. This workflow triggers on push to main
# 3. changesets/action detects pending changesets
# 4. Action creates/updates "Version Packages" PR with bumped versions + changelogs
# 5. Developer reviews and merges Version Packages PR
# 6. This workflow triggers again on that merge
# 7. Action runs `pnpm changeset publish` — checks each package against npm,
#    publishes if version is newer, skips if already published
# 8. Action creates GitHub release with changelog

      # Shallow clone (default depth=1) is intentional. changesets/action uses
      # the GitHub API (not git log) for changelog generation, and creates its
      # own branch for the Version Packages PR. Full history (fetch-depth: 0)
      # is only needed in ci.yml for `changeset status` comparison.

      # RECOVERY PROCEDURES (FR10, FR11, FR12, FR28):
      # ──────────────────────────────────────────────
      # This workflow is idempotent — safe to re-run at any point:
      #   - FR10: Re-running after failure produces no side effects
      #   - FR11: `changeset version` detects already-bumped versions and skips them
      #   - FR12: `changeset publish` checks npm registry before publishing —
      #           already-published versions are skipped, unpublished versions are published
      #
      # Recovery scenarios:
      #
      # 1. PUBLISH FAILED (version bumped in package.json but not yet on npm):
      #    → Re-run this workflow. Changesets detects the unpublished version and publishes it.
      #
      # 2. RE-RUN EXITS "NOTHING TO DO" (changesets consumed, versions already bumped):
      #    → Manual fallback from local checkout:
      #        git checkout main && git pull
      #        pnpm install && pnpm -r build
      #        npm login  # authenticate to @zookanalytics org
      #        pnpm changeset publish
      #    ⚠ Note: manual publish requires an npm automation/granular access token,
      #      will NOT include SLSA provenance attestation, and will fail with 403
      #      if token-based auth has been disabled on the npm package settings.
      #    ⚠ Note: manual commits from local checkout will be unsigned, unlike the
      #      automated flow which uses the GitHub API (commitMode: github-api) to
      #      produce signed commits. If branch protection requires signed commits,
      #      you may need to temporarily bypass or use a GPG key for manual recovery.
      #
      # 3. CHANGELOG PLUGIN CRASHES during `changeset version`:
      #    → Temporarily switch changelog in .changeset/config.json:
      #        "changelog": "@changesets/changelog-git"
      #      This unblocks publishing. Revert after the publish succeeds.
      #
      # ROLLBACK — DEPRECATE A BAD VERSION (FR27):
      # ───────────────────────────────────────────
      # npm does not allow unpublishing versions older than 72 hours.
      # The primary rollback mechanism is deprecation:
      #
      #   npm deprecate @zookanalytics/agent-env@<version> "reason for deprecation"
      #
      # This marks the version as deprecated — users see a warning on `npm install`.
      # The deprecated version remains installable but is flagged.
      # To undo deprecation: npm deprecate @zookanalytics/agent-env@<version> ""
      #
      # After deprecating, publish a fix version:
      #   1. Create a changeset: pnpm changeset (select agent-env, patch bump)
      #   2. Commit and merge the changeset to main
      #   3. The automated pipeline handles the rest
      #
      # TRUSTED PUBLISHING (OIDC) CONFIGURATION (FR29, FR30):
      # ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
      # This workflow uses npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) instead of a stored NPM_TOKEN.
      # No secret to leak, rotate, or expire — authentication is tied to this repo+workflow.
      #
      # Configuration (completed 2026-02-06):
      #   - Package: @zookanalytics/agent-env
      #   - Repository: ZookAnalytics/bmad-orchestrator
      #   - Workflow: publish.yml
      #   - npm settings: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zookanalytics/agent-env/access
      #
      #   - Package: @zookanalytics/keystone-workflows
      #   - Repository: ZookAnalytics/bmad-orchestrator
      #   - Workflow: publish.yml
      #   - npm settings: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zookanalytics/keystone-workflows/access
      #
      # How it works:
      #   1. The `id-token: write` permission allows GitHub to issue an OIDC token
      #   2. npm verifies the token matches the configured repository and workflow
      #   3. If verified, the publish is authorized — no NPM_TOKEN needed
      #
      # To verify/fix Trusted Publishing:
      #   1. Go to npmjs.com/package/@zookanalytics/agent-env/access
      #   2. Check "Publishing access" → "Trusted Publishing" section
      #   3. Verify repository is "ZookAnalytics/bmad-orchestrator"
      #   4. Verify workflow name is "publish.yml"
      #   5. If OIDC fails with 403/401, re-check steps 3-4 — names must match exactly
      #   6. If package is unlinked, re-link via npm package settings
      #
      # GITHUB RELEASES (FR8, NFR10):
      # After a successful publish, changesets/action creates a GitHub release
      # per published package. Release notes come from @changesets/changelog-github
      # entries (configured in .changeset/config.json). The `contents: write`
      # permission above authorizes release creation via the GitHub API.
